= ColorConverter Library for Arduino =

This library allows you convert HSI color model values to RGB and RGBW values. I wrote it because I wanted this conversion for programmable LEDs like WS2812 or APA102C as well as for DMX-512 lighting control. It also allows you to convert RGB values to HSI values.

With HSI values, the overall power output of the LED remains constant, and the brightness of the eye remains constant, when fading across hues. This makes for more consistent color fades. For a better explanation, and the example code on which this is based, see http://blog.saikoled.com/post/43693602826/why-every-led-light-should-be-using-hsi[Saiko LED's blog post].

= Commands =


== HSItoRGB

.Syntax
----
ColorConverter.HSItoRGB(hue, saturation, intensity);
----

.Parameters
* hue (_float_) - color hue, 0 to 360 degrees
* saturation (_float_) - color saturation, 0 to 100
* intensity (_float_) - color intensity, 0 to 100

.Returns
RGBColor (_struct_) - a structure containing four ints: red, green, blue, and white. All three or red, green, and blue will range from 0 to 255. For this function, white is always 0.

.Example
----
RGBColor c = ColorConverter.HSItoRGB(hue, saturation, intensity);
Serial.print(c.red);
Serial.print(" ");
Serial.print(c.green);
Serial.print(" ");
Serial.println(c.blue);
----

== HSItoRGBW

.Syntax
----
ColorConverter.HSItoRGB(hue, saturation, intensity);
----

.Parameters
* hue (_float_) - color hue, 0 to 360 degrees
* saturation (_float_) - color saturation, 0 to 100
* intensity (_float_) - color intensity, 0 to 100

.Returns
RGBColor (_struct_) - a structure containing four ints: red, green, blue, and white. All four will range from 0 to 255.

.Example
----
RGBColor c = ColorConverter.HSItoRGB(hue, saturation, intensity);
Serial.print(c.red);
Serial.print(" ");
Serial.print(c.green);
Serial.print(" ");
Serial.print(c.blue);
Serial.print(" ");
Serial.print(c.white);
----

== RGBtoHSI

.Syntax
----
ColorConverter.RGBtoHSI(red, green,  blue);
----

.Parameters
* red (_int_) - red value, 0 to 255
* green (_int_) - green value, 0 to 255
* blue (_int_) - blue value, 0 to 255

.Returns
HSIColor (_struct_) - a structure containing three floats: hue, saturation, and intensity.Hue will range from 0 to 359. Saturation and intensity will range from 0 to 100.

.Example
----
HSIColor c = ColorConverter.RGBtoHSI(red, green, blue);
Serial.print(c.hue);
Serial.print(" ");
Serial.print(c.saturation);
Serial.print(" ");
Serial.println(c.intensity);
